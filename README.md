# Berries
A project which changes Pokemon Berries from MDScript to JavaPlugin with configuration
Eventually planning to integrate with Apricorns and Pokeballs (snowballs)



##Configuration

1. version
  * No need to touch this, nothing changes if you do.
2. berryPatches
  * A List of Worldguard regions that corresponds to each spot a berry can either be planted, or grow into.
3. berries
  * A List of Berries as they would be read by the lore on the item. Ex. An apple with lore Aguav would only activate as a berry if the entry Aguav were in the config here, AND the color of the lore matched the `color` entry.
    + color: A single character, 0-9,a-f,k,l-o that matches the color code on the berry's lore seen in game. A berry with lore *Oran* would only activate if this entry were l.
    + stalktype: The typeID of the plant which appears when the berry is planted. Typically 59:`crops`, 141:`carrot`, or 142:`potato`
    + effects: a comma-delimited list of what the berry does when activated. Valid values are:
      - `smallheal`: heals the user for 4 Health (2 Hearts)
      - `largeheal`: heals the user for 10 Health (5 Hearts)
      - `confusionflavor`: gives the user Confusion potion effect if their UUID corresponds to the flavor of the berry

      - `fixitem`: for attached berries, gives the item 1/4 of its durability back
      - `boostmcmmoluck`: gives the user the permission to boost mcmmo Luck benefits for a short time (Doesn't rely on mcmmo, just gives a timed permission node)
      - `quarterdamage`: incoming attacks have their damage reduced to 1/4 of original damage
      - `reducedamage`: incoming attacks have their damage reduced by 5 (2.5 Hearts)
      - `addconfusion`: gives the user confusion potioneffect with amplifier 1, duration 5 seconds
    + flavor: only used in `confusionflavor`, determines which UUID will get confused by using it
    + uses: a comma-delimited list of how the berry can be activated by the user. Valid values are:
      - `consume`: activates when the user eats the item
      - `attack`: activates when the user is attacking another player or entity
